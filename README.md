## About Me

I am a software engineer with interests in high-performance computing and cybersecurity.

Currently, I am experimenting with Rust, GPU compute, and path tracing algorithms, but I like learning a little bit of everything. Some of my favorite personal projects are listed below.
I also love teaching people about the things I am passionate about, so feel free to reach out if you want to know more about my work.
