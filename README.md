## About

I am a full stack developer with three years of experience in application development and cloud computing. I am passionate about graphics, high-performance computing, and Rust, and I am always eager to learn something new.

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing board games (with some occasional Dungeons and Dragons), and experimenting with virtual reality and whatever else catches my interest.
